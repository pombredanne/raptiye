wordpress.py

This module aims to import all necessary data from Wordpress blogs..

Since comments in Wordpress can be written by Anonymous users (which 
raptiye doesn't let), the importer assigns all previous comments to the
Anonymous user of raptiye.. No other "new" comment can be owned by 
Anonymous user..

I don't care about the registered users in Wordpress.. Therefore I'm not
importing them.. There were several users which were probably created by 
some spam makers.. raptiye has captcha and moderation "for once" for 
that..

The importer works just for MySQL.. Therefore you need to have necessary 
packages like python-mysql..

The script assumes that you've already installed the necessary tables for
your Django applications initially and there's no data written in it!
