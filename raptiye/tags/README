Default raptiye template uses tags exclusively. So tags app is
enabled by default.



--- INSTALLATION ----------------------------

In order to install this application you should create the 
local_settings.py file if it doesn't exist inside the project 
root directory, create a copy of INSTALLED_APPS tuple and 
comment out:

* tagging
* raptiye.tags

and sync your database. Last, you should comment out the related
line inside urls.py.



--- MIGRATION -------------------------------

If you're migrating from an older release of raptiye then you
should copy (or link) tag_importer_20.py to project root directory
and issue the following commands:

export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE='raptiye.settings'
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/../
./tag_importer_20.py

This will convert all your tags to new raptiye (2.0).

NOTE: If you have any tags with a name that consist forward slash 
(/) in it, you should rename it without using that character, 
otherwise tags app won't work!
